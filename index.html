							<h2 class="heading-3">My Background.</h2>
							<p>
								Born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota, I didn't find my passion for web development 
								until I was an undergrad student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017.
							</p>
							<p>
								In a software engineering class, my group leveraged Angular for our group project to 
								build a social media app for teachers. I picked up Angular by watching YouTube tutorials, 
								reading documentation, and experimenting with classmates. I was hooked.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since then, I've had the privilege of 
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connorbarrett97/" target="_blank" class="link-4" rel="noopener">working</a>
								with diverse and global teams, and large and small projects, with opportunities to learn 
								from experts in areas such as system design, data modelling, application development, and security. 
								I'm fortunate to have been able to design and develop applications that serve the Manufacturing, 
								Healthcare, and Energy industries.

										<p>
											Early in my career at <a href="https://www.3m.com/" target="_blank" class="link-2" rel="noopener">3M</a>, 
											I started scrappy and quickly grew into roles I never expected. I spearheaded internal web and mobile 
											projects for various business groups and the executive council, helping POC technologies for strategic 
											cloud providers and BI tooling for global operations. I became the global Power BI administrator, 
											overseeing more than 20,000 Power BI users and super users worldwide, while driving analytics and 
											strategic adoption of these tools across the company. Working out of the global headquarters in 
											Maplewood through COVID changes, my network grew quickly globally and I learned how to deliver 
											solutions that directly impact worldwide business operations.

										<p>
											Later, I moved to <a href="https://www.dnv.com/" target="_blank" class="link-2" rel="noopener">DNV</a> 
											where I was excited about the opportunity to lead web efforts for a highly talented engineering team 
											with great backend depth. I wore many hats across data engineering, data visualization, fullstack web 
											development, design, and infrastructure while building massive-scale systems that serve utility companies 
											across the US. We supported the data and analytics for massive energy efficiency and EV adoption programs 
											in an industry-leading way. Security became a huge focus for me at DNV, where I earned both green and red belt 
											certifications and mentored other engineers to gain security proficiency as cybersecurity became a core 
											business area for DNV in Europe and globally. I worked hard to enable modern experiences and reliable systems, 
											and we shared a passion for protecting the environment and supporting the clean energy transition at scale.
										</p>
										<p>
											I also won DNV's next-gen competition in the fall of 2024 in Oslo, Norway, where I worked in a team 
											of 4 with representation from Mexico, USA, UK, and Norway. We proposed a salmon farming analytics 
											solution to reduce salmon mortality through leveraging Akerbla's proprietary salmon testing data in 
											a tool that would give fish health experts everything they need to combat that crisis, expanding DNV's 
											presence in the aquaculture space where Norway dominates globally. We won that competition and the 
											project was funded to continue as an internal start-up.

											a passion for me. At Livefront I continue to grow every day and build thoughtful software that helps 
											people and businesses work more effectively.

										<p>
											Some of my favorite technologies for front-end development include

										My Favorite Free Creative Resources for Front-End
										Developers
									</h2>
								</div>
								<p>
									I think most would probably agree that googling
									things and tapping into developer communities is a
									key part of being an effective developer —
									regardless of whether you’ve been coding for 5
									months, or 5 years. When you have millions of smart
									people sharing resources, it makes a lot of sense to
									learn from them whenever possible. Beyond just
									leveraging google, there are tons of free tools and
									services at the finger tips of developers nowadays.
									When it comes to front-end development, I wanted to
									share some resources that I use a lot to help expand
									my own creative boundaries.

										UI Kitten 5.0 Technical Review
									</h3>
								</div>
								<p class="paragraph small">
									If you’re getting started on a new mobile project
									and React Native is your technology of choice
									(Flutter is an emerging alternative for
									cross-platform development), picking a component
									library or UI framework can be a daunting task. The
									goal of this article isn’t necessarily to sway you
									one way or another on this decision making process.
									I highly recommend reading about other popular UI
									frameworks such as NativeBase, React Native
									Elements, Shoutem, Teaset, etc. The list goes on and
									on. I can’t honestly say that I believe there’s a
									clear front-runner in this space, given that I’ve
									only really used UI Kitten. What I can do, and plan
									to use the remainder of this article to do, however,
									is give a detailed explanation of what I took into
									consideration before choosing UI Kitten for my
									mobile project, and how that is going for me so far.
